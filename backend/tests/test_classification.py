"""llm_classify model wiring: it uses the (cheap) classify_model by default and honors an override.

An A/B showed Flash-Lite matches full Flash on the labeled taxonomy examples (identical accuracy,
100% agreement), so classification runs on the cheaper tier. These tests pin the model selection;
the Vertex call itself is stubbed.
